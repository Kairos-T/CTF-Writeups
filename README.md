Hi! I'm Kairos, a Year 1 Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic :mortar\_board:. I'm passionate about all things related to technology and cybersecurity (especially forensics!). On this page, you'll find a collection of my experiences from various Capture The Flag (CTF) events and labs I've participated in. I'll be sharing write-ups and insights about the challenges and solutions I encountered along the way.



Feel free to contact me through my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kairoshestiatay/) or [email](mailto:contact@kairostay.com)! You can also view other projects on my [personal website](https://www.kairostay.com). Have a good one!
